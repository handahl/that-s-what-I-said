# **That's What I Said**

**Your conversations, your data, your private universe. One timeline to bring order to your thoughts.**

"That's What I Said" is a secure, private, local-first desktop application that imports your chat histories from LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) into a single, organized, and searchable timeline. It's designed for anyone who uses multiple platforms to think, create, and communicate, and wants to bring all those scattered conversations back into one place.

All data processing, storage, and analysis happens exclusively on your machine. **Nothing ever leaves your computer.**

### **Key Features**

* **Universal Importer:** Upload your chat archives from a huge variety of services. If it's a .json, .md, or .txt file, the app can learn to read it.  
* **LLM & Messenger Support:** It handles both AI conversations and human-to-human chats according to their nature.  
* **The Infinite Timeline:** View all your conversations, from all sources, woven together in a single, chronological, infinitely-scrolling timeline.  
* **Powerful Search:** Find anything across every conversation you've ever imported, no matter to whom you said it.  
* **Advanced Tagging:** Organize your thoughts, projects, and conversations with a flexible, multi-level tagging system.  
* **Truly Local & Private:** Built with a "local-first" architecture. Your data is encrypted on your disk and is never sent to any server.  
* **Modern & Fast:** A native desktop application that is fast, responsive, and a pleasure to use.

### **Why "That's What I Said"?**

While other tools exist for analyzing chat logs, they often focus purely on statistics and dashboards. This tool is different:

1. **It's an Archive, Not Just an Analyzer:** The primary goal is to give you a readable and searchable personal archive to help you find and reconnect with your own ideas. Insights and dashboards are a feature, not the entire product.  
2. **LLMs are a First-Class Citizen:** In the age of AI, your conversations with models are critical parts of your creative process. We treat them as such.  
3. **Security Through Architecture:** By being a desktop application, we can provide a higher level of security and performance.

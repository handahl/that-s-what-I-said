      "The `.ai-constraints.md` file specifies 'Backend: Node.js (local-only)', while the `README.md` and `Project Concept.md` refer to the application as a 'secure, local-first desktop application' using 'Tauri' for the desktop shell. The `package.json` also shows `@tauri-apps/cli` as a dev dependency. This indicates a potential discrepancy or an incomplete understanding of how Node.js is utilized within the Tauri desktop context for local-only operations. Clarification is needed on the exact role of Node.js if it's not the primary backend.",
      "The `types.ts` file defines `GeminiExport` and `GeminiTakeoutExport` interfaces. However, `ROADMAP.md` only mentions adding parsers for 'Gemini (.json)'. It's crucial to confirm if both formats (standard Gemini export and Google Takeout style) are intended to be supported in v0.2 to ensure comprehensive parsing capabilities and avoid ambiguity."

    "improvement_recommendations": [
      "Explicitly define the architecture's backend components in more detail, clarifying the relationship between Tauri (Rust) and any Node.js components for local processing.",
      "Ensure all file parsing scenarios, especially for diverse formats like Gemini's potential variations, are explicitly covered in the roadmap and test plans.",
      "Add detailed documentation for cryptographic key management, including how keys are derived, stored (in memory), and securely cleared.",
      "Expand `ROADMAP.md` with specific performance targets for critical features like initial load time, search response, and import speeds.",
      "Implement a robust logging and error reporting mechanism (local-only, not external) to help diagnose issues in production without compromising privacy.",
      "Consider adding pre-commit hooks to automatically run `lint`, `format:check`, and `test` to enforce code quality and consistency."

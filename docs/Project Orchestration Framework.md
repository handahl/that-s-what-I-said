# **Project Orchestration Framework**

This framework outlines the essential components for structuring and executing the "That's What I Said" project. The emphasis is on clarity, strategic direction, and systematic execution, ensuring transparent processes and predictable outcomes.

As the orchestrator, your role is to define the vision, set the strategic direction, validate logical constructs, and manage the project's progression. The AI serves as the technical execution arm, converting precise instructions into functional code. This documentation is designed to facilitate that symbiotic relationship.
